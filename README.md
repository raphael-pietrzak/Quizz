# Quizz App

This is a simple quiz app that I made using React. It fetches questions from a JSON file and displays them to the user. The user can then select an answer and see if they were correct or not. The app also keeps track of the user's score and displays it at the end of the quiz.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
